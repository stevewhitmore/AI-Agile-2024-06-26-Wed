# AI Agile 

Notes and demo project from the 2024 KCDC workshop.

Ideas:

- Code review based on standards/ADRs
    - CI plugins for GitLab?
- Enhancing git commit messages/release notes
- Generating unit tests
- Chatbot for documentation exploration/explanation
- Templates for ticket creation

## Workshop use case

Take spreadsheet tracking estimated time vs actual time for tasks done by 3 employees and analyze it.

```bash
# Set up environment
$ python -m venv .venv \
. .venv/bin/activate \
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run jupyter to visualize analysis
$ jupyter lab 
```
